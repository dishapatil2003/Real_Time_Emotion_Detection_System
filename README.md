Real-Time Emotion Detection System
Overview : 
The Real-Time Emotion Detection System is an AI-powered application that recognizes human emotions using facial expressions. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for emotion classification and provides real-time predictions via a GUI.

Features
Detects 7 emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise
Real-time emotion detection via webcam
User-friendly GUI for seamless interaction
Built with OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras
Lightweight model optimized for real-time performance

Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras – Model training and emotion classification
OpenCV – Real-time face detection
Tkinter – GUI development

Model
